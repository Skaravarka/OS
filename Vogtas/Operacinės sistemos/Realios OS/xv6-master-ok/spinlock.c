  // 1) All loads and stores are not reordered with locked instruction.
  // 2) Since locked instruction has a serializing effect. All memory
  //    modifications are effective after executing it.

  // serializing effect. So executing it will not make all memory modifications 
  // effective. So this version of release has a weakened memory ordering. But 
  // a new acquire has a serializing effect. So this version also has correct
